Read an image that contains lines of several lengths.
Convert into greyscale image.
Find all the edge points in the image using any suitable edge detection scheme.
Apply Hough transform to detect the lines in the image.
After calculating the Hough space, the next step is to find the peaks by using a threshold T that represent the minimum number of intersections to detect a line.
Try different values of T and for each value display the original image and highlight the detected lines on it.
 
Experiment-2:
Read an image and convert it to gray scale.
Let the user to interactively select set of points or locations inside the image (seed points).
Also, let the user to decide a threshold value T.
Apply region growing algorithm to find the region of each seed point.
Display the original image and highlight the detected regions on it.
